Don't worry, it's only a matter of time.
If I knew!
Yeah, why?
I did 7 at Flappy Bird, you can't imagine how happy I was.
Twitter makes me feel guilty... I really have to watch Teen Wolf.

#ItAnnoysMeWhen someone asks you the same thing, several times in the day.

To succeed at Flappy Bird, you have to become its friend.
Does anyone have this problem?
I have to watch Teen Wolf but I'm in training.
My brother was about to take a kick from Zlatan
Today there's teen wolf yeaaaaaah
Zlatan Zlatan it's too much
My best score at Flappy Bird is 21 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
When you see their disillusionments after the March for equality of 1983, you understand the anger that was expressed in 2005. #Infrarouge
But now I'm gonna watch a bit Teen Wolf or Pretty Little Liars.
Melissa Ponzio spoiled me, now I have to live all day with this IMPORTANT information. AAH! #teenwolf
The one and only positive point on Tuesday is that in the evening I watch Teen wolf
Excellent journalistic work. #infrarouge
I can't drink normally
I work alone too
I'm 30 years old
I'm playing Flappy Bird
flappy wings is much easier than flappy bird
Zlatan didn't want us to go to bed late the naughty boy
Flappy Bird: make the little bird fit in the hole without touching the edges. #flappybird
#ItAnnoysMeWhen someone gets out of my room without closing the door.
When I'm home, I'll watch Private Practice and then Teen Wolf.
Between Twitter and Flappy Bird... I think birds are really trying to fuck up my social life. <
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I introduce a person to a friend and this person becomes closer to her than to me..
Pfff, Zlatan would have been more useful on M6 at that moment, princess Leia would really need him!
You see Lionel, that's why you can stay in your homeless people club. We don't need you. #Zlatan
I scored 52 at flappy bird, I plan to organize a party to celebrate.
my Teen Wolf episode is downloading **
This game makes me freak out!! #flappybird
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I see all these idiots at the #manifpourtous then I wonder why there are so many assholes in France!! @cauetofficiel
at the same time I moved ,
For some people the don't touch my friend is going to become touch yourself my friend #infrarouge
A guy took a cab in Stockholm he found the wallet of ...Zlatan, it was a few days ago. WWW86
Beating your high score at Flappy Bird, it's like winning at the casino... You always play again to do more...
so that means I forced myself to resist the product,
Yep!And it will be a nice gift for you too
But idk, if he dies, the show will not be the same c'mon... I don't know it's not possible teen wolf without stiles
I don't know about you, but seeing the joy of great players like Zlatan, Motta, Verratti I think it's wonderful 👌💙❤️🙈 #FCNPSG #TeamPSG
Teen Wolf is in TT! happy day today the episode is coming out!
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I'm listening to a song on my phone and someone decides to speak to me
I want to say that Farida #Belghoul wasn't a walker in 1983 she did the Convergences 84 one #infrarouge
Zlatan Ibrahimovic: "I like to play against this team because the goal is bad and it allows for me to improve my numbers." #FCNPSG #PSG
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I can't meet my idol.
and so all day long I'm alone except in the evening when there's my mother...
Before it was doodle jump now they break our balls with flappy bird lol pathetic!
But why? lol
I always spend my civics hours playing Candy Crush and Flappy Bird
I managed to annoy 3 people with Flappy Bird
Proud of my Nantes guys anyway!
There are gifs from the teen wolf episode everywhere I'm crying I didn't even saw the one from last tuesday
Flappy Bird dis game requires the mental focus of a jedi and strong nerves.
Jeff Davis is the creator of Teen Wolf and Criminal Minds. I love him.
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I want to participate and the teacher takes so much time before asking me that I forget what I was about to say <<<<<<<
in addition I have a lot of thoughts in my head
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I see buddies laughing along with people I don't like
#ItAnnoysMeWhen people criticize something they don't even know
I don't understand, I can't manage to get the bird into the pipes at Flappy Bird
I feel I'm living the same day everyday.
I was convinced Candy Crush was a true cancer, until the day I discovered Flappy Bird.
Zlatan's zen is small compared to his talent
"They tried to sell us a political dream through 11 guys running after a ball" #infrarouge
#ItAnnoysMeWhen my dreams are shattered in 2 seconds.
#ItAnnoysMeWhen the LoS understand they're wrong and they say: "Anyway we love them for their music"
In a wall, some players protect their balls, zlatan protects his nose ...
Thanks to Zlatan who apparently also wants to see the doc! #infrarouge #françaisDorigineContrôlée
Thanks to Zlatan who apparently also wants to see the doc! #infrarouge #françaisDorigineContrôlée

ZLATAN is a good hunter, he killed 11 little ducks by himself WWW45
if I can give you one advice it's simply to tell you that all that is only psychological.
Roman Godfrey watched Teen Wolf (2011) • S03E17 Silverfinger and is back drawing circles on his favorite gypsy.
So without freaking you out you should go see a toxicologist who I think will prescribe you a treatment or some pills urgently.
"No, I am your father." Or one of the biggest revelations of the cinema! #StarWarsV
actually I don't really know what to do except waiting and maybe getting through it...
But as Cllaude532 said, consulting a psychiatrist can also help you to get rid of those voices filling your head.
I can't score more than 2 at flappy bird 😔🔫🔫
I need to stop looking at my feed , some people are spoiling on @MTVteenwolf
I still feel queasy ,
Magic Zlatan scoring a goal in the last 3 minutes!
All my class playing Flappy bird in the hall lol
Of course no Teen Wolf and BatB yet I don't even know why I'm suprised

With the girls we tried Flappy Bird, we shouldn't have.

Zlatan and again Zlatan loool

Keep your spirits up, and stay positive.
Most of the young people in the suburbs are unemployed, they're constantly turned down, they're rejected they live in withdrawal #infrarouge
The Doctor tells me to wait for the product to come down it will take a few months and that's all,
Your favorite fleabag is back tonight! #StarWarsV
I'm at the point when Luke still wants to pick up Leia and doesn't want to let her for Harisson Ford Fiesta. #StarWarsV

France is a republican and mixed country. Period. #infrarouge
@JohnDoe574 @JohnDoe575 I don't know I was focused on my teen Wolf episode and it just happened lol
I definitely don't know how to play flappy bird!
Thanks to the population office for having made me wait long enough to do 40 at flappy bird
Today, it may be the shittiest day in all my existence, zero fucks given because there's TEEN WOLF.
When I started playing flappy bird I thought you had to get the beastie into the pipes --'
I'm so late for all my tv shows. All except Teen Wolf, I can't be late with Teen Wolf 😍
to those who didn't see teen wolf yet, prepare yourselves mentally for the end of the episode, just an advice
Tonight #StarWarsV the best episodes of all the series with the arrival of @Yoda_Officiel and the famous sentence by @DarkVador_Off
A very simple trick in those cases, you take deep inhalations, you breathe quietly, and you settle yourself in a place where you feel safe, and not too close to the walls (yes sometimes you can feel like they're closing on you).
it soothes me but the voices in my head don't stop,
Thanks for reading my message and sorry about the spelling mistakes..
Zlatan knows the wrapping up schedule of the regional press, indeed
Zlatan played 5 minutes in this game ... two goals 😍
Yeah no kidding, I drank last night but it had been two weeks.
I get up and I'm still having the effect of LSD and everything
My boyfriend did 24 at flappy bird I did 6 I was happy..
People on Flappy bird are seriously insane, they're too far for us! WWW36
A guy in Stockholm found Zlatan's credit cards in a cab.. Only blacks.. Chill WWW87
I want to play flappy bird but I know it's going to piss me off
Nope Nope Nope NOOOOPE NOOOPE... In short, it's the end of the Teen Wolf episode
afterwards I sleep rly bad and am sick the day after and above all I hate myself,
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I'm writing a message and my phone dies because I don't have anymore battery left ...
That moment when the twin towers also fall on Arabs from France... dreadful and unreal feeling. #infrarouge
while the Teen Wolf cast is tweeting like crazy, we are in class hashtag suicide and depression
A new episode of Teen Wolf has been released and you're asking me to go to school peacefully!? Pff
It's funny, in flappy bird you don't touch the pipe but the bird falls down anyway. Ah. Ah. Ah.
#ItAnnoysMeWhen although we all put away our things, closed our bags and put the chairs on the tables, the teacher says "take your planners out"...
#infrarouge the heartland of france is not racist sorry madam but lol
346 passes for PSG, 27 for Nantes! #FCNPSG
A guy took a cab in Stockholm a few days ago and he stumbled upon Zlatan's wallet WWW48
In short, I'll watch teen wolf this afternoon and then I'll work
@JohnDoe714 Ah great! Well I'm in class now, and tonight it's #StarWarsV on tv, so I'm not playing anymore today, be back tomorrow :)
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I send tweets to my idols and they don't answer me fck soab
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I say "good morning" to someone and that person answers me "good night"
In the end the real symbol is the Keffiyeh, not the yellow hand :-) #françaisDorigineContrôlée #infrarouge

When I get home I watch Teen Wolf directly. *-*
Why are super interesting shows late at night? #infrarouge #France2
flappy bird, or my source of entertainment while I'm sick
I'm weaned off alcohol since a few years, but I can't convince myself I will never drink another drop of alcohol, since I want to, not enough will maybe,
I get up I see Stiles in TT... I stay in bed and I watch Teen Wolf instead of going to do the cleaning eh!
Several months after a dose, especially when you're mixing, you can have some effects again, especially after a sudden stop of the substances.
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I spend a day with my girlfriend and in the end it finishes with: "See you tomorrow, no fucking" @JohnDoe843
I'm patiently waiting for the teen wolf episode while looking away when I see spoilers on tumblr and twitter.
In a recent time, young arabs were dying being shot like animals in France projects. "Français d'origine contrôlée". #infrarouge
last time I binged a show like that it was Suits, and before it was teen wolf actually #TWD
And Zlatan who keeps emptying his nose on the field .. You're good but youre disgusting .
kudos to the Nantes canaries for their performance against the parisians.. it was a close call ..
I think I went back too far in my TL, I almost got teen wolf spoiled /;
why do I have this relationship with alcohol even though a lot of people can drink normally??
I want to be in the afternoon to be able to watch teen wolf :(
#OFF Proud to be from Nantes, always there in victory as in defeat, GO NANTES!
Ok I'm gonna get ready and stop Twitter this morning because there's teen wolf spoiling
#ItAnnoysMeWhen you give a nickname to a buddy, and then everybody calls him that afterwards..
