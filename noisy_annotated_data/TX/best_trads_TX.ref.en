A waste of time that Flappy Bird I swore
Cllaude529
Does anyone have this problem?
Don't worry, it's only a matter of time.
Great Zlatan plucked 11 poor canaries tonight.
Hello,

When you see their disillusionments after the March for equality of 1983, you understand the anger that was expressed in 2005. #Infrarouge
The Doctor tells me to wait for the product to come down it will take a few months and that's all,
I have a dilemma: do I start Teen Wolf knowing that I'll have to stop in the middle of the episode to go to class? AAARGH
Beating your high score at Flappy Bird, it's like winning at the casino... You always play again to do more...
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I see your face.
#ItAnnoysMeWhen people don't answer texts whereas when you see them, they're always on their phones.
With the girls we tried Flappy Bird, we shouldn't have.
Zlatan Zlatan it's too much
Dylan Sprayberry joins the Teen Wolf casting for season 4. Particularly, he played the part of young Clark Kent in Man of Steel.

This afternoon no high school for me I'm gonna watch Teen Wolf *,*

To succeed at Flappy Bird, you have to become its friend.
Tuesday night = Teen Wolf = may the day end quickly
When I'm home, I'll watch Private Practice and then Teen Wolf.
@JohnDoe574 @JohnDoe575 I don't know I was focused on my teen Wolf episode and it just happened lol
Between Twitter and Flappy Bird... I think birds are really trying to fuck up my social life. <

my girlfriend didn't understand what happened to me and didn't care much
Of course no Teen Wolf and BatB yet I don't even know why I'm suprised
Proud of my Nantes guys anyway!
Zlatan didn't want us to go to bed late the naughty boy

#ItAnnoysMeWhen I see buddies laughing along with people I don't like

Omg When I see the reaction of the Wolfies who saw last night episode I'm afraid to see it tonight now #TeenWolf
so I take the car and then I go to work
Tuesday challenge: to avoid all tweets in relation to Teen Wolf.
A new episode of Teen Wolf has been released and you're asking me to go to school peacefully!? Pff
It's funny, in flappy bird you don't touch the pipe but the bird falls down anyway. Ah. Ah. Ah.
last time I binged a show like that it was Suits, and before it was teen wolf actually #TWD
They were ashamed to give their first names... I'm ashamed for that France who treated them like this #infrarouge
#ItAnnoysMeWhen people criticize something they don't even know
I feel I'm living the same day everyday.
I have to watch the Teen Wolf episode
I'm so bad at flappy bird that I do a "better" score playing left-handed than right-handed..
is it zlatan, or ibrahimovic who scored? #tweetlikeagirl
I did 7 at Flappy Bird, you can't imagine how happy I was.
Yeah no kidding, I drank last night but it had been two weeks.
Zlatan's credit cards found in a cab... Shall we talk about it WWW44
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I introduce a person to a friend and this person becomes closer to her than to me..
A guy took a cab in Stockholm a few days ago and he stumbled upon Zlatan's wallet WWW48
Carbonite, a simple and handy solution to turn your ex into a most tasteful living room table. #StarWarsV
Pfff, Zlatan would have been more useful on M6 at that moment, princess Leia would really need him!
When I started playing flappy bird I thought you had to get the beastie into the pipes --'
You see Lionel, that's why you can stay in your homeless people club. We don't need you. #Zlatan
At present it's been 5 months today that I had this bad and regarding my vision I'm still seeing from behind a mirror
A guy took a cab in Stockholm he found Zlatan's wallet, he just put it on his fb account WWW65
But as Cllaude532 said, consulting a psychiatrist can also help you to get rid of those voices filling your head.
Looool ZLATAN wants his revenge on the blacks, he couldn't swallow it for RIO Mavuba
Since earlier I play flappy bird and candy crush #CoolLife
I still feel queasy ,
I was so so happy when Nantes players scored, I yelled everywhere in the house**
I'll review tonight and I (screen for proof) won't watch teen wolf until I'm finished yes yes you read correctly
I'm gonna watch teen wolf
#OFF Proud to be from Nantes, always there in victory as in defeat, GO NANTES!
Trying Flappy bird out of curiosity means accepting the permanent defeat, nervous giggles and the questioning of your abilities lol
Why are super interesting shows late at night? #infrarouge #France2
Yep!And it will be a nice gift for you too
Zlatan and again Zlatan loool
A very simple trick in those cases, you take deep inhalations, you breathe quietly, and you settle yourself in a place where you feel safe, and not too close to the walls (yes sometimes you can feel like they're closing on you).
I want to watch Teen Wolf. I can't. I have to go to class. I don't want to. I have a test. Lol. I didn't learn. I was too depressed for it.
We're calling the Nantes players canaries, but the only thing that looks like a beak on this grass is Zlatan's nose #FCNPSG
JohnDoe665 just watched Teen Wolf (2011) S03E17 [Silverfinger] and he's on his way to teach Castiel humanity.
the sun is rising and I begin to sleep because I had just realized there was nothing,
#ItAnnoysMeWhen someone asks you the same thing, several times in the day.

A guy in Sweden found Zlatan's credit cards WWW64
All the Americans are narrating the episode. NOOOOO!! #TeenWolf
France is a republican and mixed country. Period. #infrarouge
I managed to annoy 3 people with Flappy Bird
if I can give you one advice it's simply to tell you that all that is only psychological.
Stop breaking our balls with your flappy bird now!!!
we get at my place and there they all leave me alone at home with my girlfriend sleeping...,
Zlatan all your life you're scoring goals I swear
I'm so late for all my tv shows. All except Teen Wolf, I can't be late with Teen Wolf üòç
This morning in my tl we were just me and @JohnDoe641 desperately spamming, everyone else was watching teen Wolf LOOL
I'm watching Teen Wolf with my cat, she's purring in her sleep while I'm dying from feelings in front of the twins
May the Hashtag Force be with you! #StarWarsV poke @vw_france WWW39
New episode of #TeenWolf , I'm not there for anybody :D
No room for luck, Zlatan let his magic happen. #DARELIKEZLATAN pic.twitter.com/1nA7CW7yRm
Personally I don't play Flappy Bird, and I'm fine with that!
#ItAnnoysMeWhen I tweet something and it takes time to go through!
Zlatan played 5 minutes in this game ... two goals üòç
I get up and I'm still having the effect of LSD and everything
At Flappy Bird when my Bird has 10 Im so happy #TeamFail Loool
Whatever happens we're all proud to be from Nantes despite the defeat! #NantaisForEver
Proud of the Nantes players tonight, in spite of the 2-1 defeat against Zlatan. The state of mind in second period was great! Go Nantes. #FCNPSG
Thanks to Zlatan who apparently also wants to see the doc! #infrarouge #fran√ßaisDorigineContr√¥l√©e
Thanks to Zlatan who apparently also wants to see the doc! #infrarouge #fran√ßaisDorigineContr√¥l√©e
The Nantes Israeli player who enters the field and says the Shema #Magnificient
The things in Teen Wolf they look like Chitauris dressed up as samourai
This morning I was having a dream in another dream that I was awake so weird when I heard my alarm clock It reminded me Teenwolf
With @JohnDoe471 we play Flappy Bird in English class. We're going crazy! x)
"No, I am your father." Or one of the biggest revelations of the cinema! #StarWarsV
#ItAnnoysMeWhen you give a nickname to a buddy, and then everybody calls him that afterwards..
actually I don't really know what to do except waiting and maybe getting through it...
I'm ashamed, of who I become when I've been drinking and I suffer from it,
Last night I watched a Teen Wolf episode + 3 episodes of PLL. Perfect night!
Ok I'm gonna get ready and stop Twitter this morning because there's teen wolf spoiling
That moment when the twin towers also fall on Arabs from France... dreadful and unreal feeling. #infrarouge
For real the day I score 50 at flappy bird I throw a big party at home
afterwards I sleep rly bad and am sick the day after and above all I hate myself,
why do I have this relationship with alcohol even though a lot of people can drink normally??
kudos to the Nantes canaries for their performance against the parisians.. it was a close call ..
I'm patiently waiting for the teen wolf episode while looking away when I see spoilers on tumblr and twitter.
I'm going to see an Ophtalmologist in early january but I don't think it's going to make anything better,
Now on Fr2 the excellent documentary of @MustaphaKessous and @jtceccaldi about this uncertified label that are the #Fran√ßaisDorigineContr√¥l√©e #infrarouge
There's a guy from my class that asshole he started flappy bird this morning and now he scored 67...
But idk, if he dies, the show will not be the same c'mon... I don't know it's not possible teen wolf without stiles
