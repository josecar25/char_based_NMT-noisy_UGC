To beat your high score at Flappy Bird, it's like winning at the casino... you always play to do more...
When I see your face.
When people don't answer texts when you see them, they're always on their cell phones.

Tuesday's challenge: avoid all tweets related to Teen Wolf.
A new Teen Wolf episode has been released and you're asking me to go quietly to school?
It's funny, in flappy bird you don't touch the hose but the bird still falls.
The last time I chained to a show like this, it was Suits, and before that it was teen wolf made.
They were ashamed to give their names... I'm ashamed of that France... who could have treated them like that.
# That's when people criticize something they don't even know
I feel like I'm living the same day every day.

I'll revise tonight and I (screen for proof) won't watch Teen Wolf until I'm done. Yeah, you saw it.

I'm proud to be born, always there in victory as in defeat, go Nantes!
Trying Flappy bird out of curiosity is accepting permanent defeat, nervous lunatics and questioning his drastic abilities.
Why are the really interesting shows late at night?
Yep, and it'll be a nice gift for you too.
Zlatan and Zlatan Budd
A very simple thing in these cases, you take deep breaths, you breathe slowly, and you calm down in a place where you feel safe, and not too close to the walls.
I want to watch Teen Wolf, I can't, I have to go to class, I don't want to, I have control, I didn't learn.
They say canaries for the Nantais, but the only thing that looks like a beak on this lawn is Zlatan's nose.

I patiently expect the Teen Wolf episode by turning my eye when I see spoilers on tumblr and twitter.
